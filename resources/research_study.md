# Institutional Review Board
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that is responsible for reviewing, approving, and monitoring research involving human subjects to ensure that the rights, safety, and well-being of participants are protected. Research studies must undergo IRB approval if they involve direct data collection from human subjects and if they have to be published.

**See the chart below to understand whether your study requires IRB approval**

Secondary data (that is, data collected previously and already publicly available), does not involve direct data collection and therefore the study does not require IRB approval.

## Likert scale questions
A Likert scale is a psychometric scale commonly used in questionnaires and surveys to measure attitudes, opinions, or perceptions. It typically consists of a series of statements or questions, and respondents are asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement on a symmetric scale.
