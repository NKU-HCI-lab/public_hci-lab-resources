# HCI lab policy
This policy is designed to ensure a productive and respectful environment for all. Please, be mindful of others and our common space: don't give things for granted, respect, and care.

### 1. Access and Hours
The lab is available to students and faculty involved in research with the HCI lab or working on approved projects. You can also use the lab as a study space if you are a member of the HCI lab (you can bring up to three guests). Any other use requires permission. Unauthorized people will be asked to leave.

- You can access the lab anytime.
- Please, leave the door of the lab closed.
- If you are the last to leave the lab, turn the lights off and make sure to close the door.

### 2. Equipment and resources
Handle all equipment with care and report any issues immediately.
Personal items should not be left unattended. The lab is not responsible for lost or stolen items.

### 3. Collaboration and noise
The lab is a collaborative space. Please be considerate of others working around you. Use headphones for audio and keep conversations at a respectful volume. Group discussions are encouraged but should not disrupt others. Book a group work area if your project requires extended discussion.

### 4. Food and drinks
Food and drinks are allowed in the lab, but please, clean after your snacks and meals.

### 5. Cleanliness and maintenance
Please leave the lab as or, possibly, better than how you found it. This includes pushing in chairs, organizing equipment, and disposing of any trash. If you see any trash around, please, help collect it.

### 6. Respect and inclusion
Our lab is committed to creating an inclusive environment. Discrimination, harassment, or any form of disrespect will not be tolerated. Report any concerns or incidents to lab staff or faculty immediately.

### 7. Academic freedom and sensitive topics
Some research projects might involve sensitive topics such as religion, race, politics, sexuality, physical or mental health conditions. Provided that these topics should be discussed according to the principles outlined in this policy, if you feel uncomfortable being involved in conversations around these topics, please, share your suggestions or concerns with the lab supervisor or your instructor. If you want to report issues anonymously, please use the link to the form provided in this document.
