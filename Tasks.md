# Tasks

## Complete IRB training
NKU requires all researchers to take and pass the required research-relevant courses (animal subjects, human subjects, general research) with an 80% or higher for each individual module. To this end, visit [https://about.citiprogram.org/](https://about.citiprogram.org/) and take the Basic Human Participant Research course. Read the following guides: [Register in CTI](./resources/guide-citiprogram/citi-registration.pdf) and [CITI Training FAQs](./resources/guide-citiprogram/citi-faq.pdf).


## Create your profile on useful platforms
#### LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a professional networking platform that allows users to create a profile showcasing their work experience, education, skills, and accomplishments. It enables users to connect with colleagues, classmates, and other professionals in their field, as well as discover job opportunities, join industry-specific groups, and engage in discussions. LinkedIn serves as a powerful tool for building and maintaining professional relationships, enhancing career prospects, and staying informed about the latest developments in one's industry.

#### Google Scholar
Google Scholar is a web search engine that focuses on indexing scholarly literature, including articles, theses, books, preprints, and court opinions from various disciplines. It allows users to search for and access academic content, as well as create a public profile showcasing their publications and citations. Google Scholar helps researchers track their citation counts, find related articles, and stay up-to-date with the latest research in their field, making it an essential tool for academics and students alike.

#### GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration features for software development projects. It allows users to create a profile, host and manage their coding projects, and collaborate with other developers worldwide. GitHub enables users to store and share their code repositories, track changes, and contribute to open-source projects. It also serves as a portfolio for developers, showcasing their skills and projects to potential employers or collaborators.

#### ORCID
ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a nonprofit organization that provides researchers with a unique, persistent digital identifier. This identifier helps disambiguate researchers with similar names and ensures proper attribution of their work across various platforms and databases. By creating an ORCID profile, researchers can connect their publications, grants, and other research activities to their identifier, making it easier for others to find and cite their work. ORCID integrates with many research workflows and systems, enhancing the discoverability and recognition of researchers' contributions.
