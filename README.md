# Welcome to the HCI Lab!

If you are not sure where to start, visit our [**official website**](https://cprnhl.com/hcilab) (https://cprnhl.com/hcilab) and read this document!

By the way, we also have a [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@NKU-HCIlab) (https://www.youtube.com/@NKU-HCIlab) where we publish videos about our research.

## Purpose of this repository
This repository aims to be a one-stop-shop for all the members of the lab, whether seasoned or new ones.

## Content of the repository
This repository contains:
- The list of **[tasks you must complete](./tasks.md)** as you join the lab
- A little **[policy](./policy.md)** to help us all thrive together
- Answers to **[Frequently Asked Questions](./faq.md)** that you might have


We also have a [private repository](https://github.com/NKU-HCI-lab/restricted_hci-lab-resources) full of additional resources that you can access after becoming a member of the lab.

## Joining the HCI lab

### Why join?
1. ***We learn and work on cool stuff***: no matter what we achieve together, you will learn something new and meaningful.
2. ***We deliver results***: we have a goal-oriented mindset that will allow you to add meaningful projects and accomplishments to your resume. 
3. ***We try to have fun***: we approach our work in a professional way, but in doing so, we keep in mind that our final goal is the pursuit for happiness.

### Working in the lab
As you will join the lab, you will be:
1. Asked to complete a series of [tasks](./tasks.md)
2. Assigned to a [team working on a project](#teamwork) (based on your interests)
3. Help your team in [working on projects](#working-on-projects)
4. [Celebrate and promote](#celebrating-accomplishments) everybody's accomplishments

### Commitment
Each member of the lab will be asked to spend approximately a minimum of 5 hours on tasks. Your commitment will be as follows:
- Every two weeks
  - Attend the HCI lab meeting (30-60 minutes) 
- Every week
  - Attend the team meeting (1-2 hours)
  - Work on your tasks (minimum: 3 hours)

## Working in teams
Teams are groups of people working on projects. The HCI lab hosts several teams, each working on a different project. Usually, each member of the lab is assigned to a team based on the project they want to work on.

Some team members might be asked to work with multiple teams based on their skills. For instance, if a member is great at Python and one team needs some Python experience quickly, the member will be assigned to that team.

Regardless of team assignment, all members share resources and help each other.

### Team leaders
The role of team leaders is just to facilitate communication between the team members and lab manager(s). To this end, they:
- Make sure project tasks and progress are tracked
- Support team members in completing their tasks
- Maintain project documentation up to date.

Team leaders are not necessarily assigned based on seniority, but rather on their ability to fulfill their responsibilities. As a result, you might be assigned the role of a team leader but then realize it's not your cup of tea, which is completely fine!

## Working on projects
Each team will work on one research ***initiatives***. Research *initiatives* are very large projects that can last years and be quite overwhelming. For instance, getting a degree is an *initiative*. In the HCI lab, each team will be assigned to an *initiative*.

Luckily, project *initiatives* can be broken down into smaller, yet ***epic*** projects that can be managed in a much more reasonable time (e.g., one or more days, one or more weeks, one or more months). For instance, taking a course is an example of an *epic*. In the case of the HCI lab, a research study can be considered an *epic*.

*Epics* can be further broken down into ***milestones*** representing big accomplishments that we want to achieve to advance epics and initiatives. Milestones can be achieved in a matter of days or weeks. For instance, passing a test for a course is an example of a *milestone*. In the case of the HCI lab, finishing a research paper can be considered a *milestone*.

In order to accomplish each *milestone*, team members will be asked to work on ***tasks***. Tasks can be realized in a matter of minutes or hours. For instance, reading the book to prepare for a test and writing an essay are examples of tasks.  In the case of the HCI lab, creating a survey, fixing some code, or writing the section of a paper are examples of *tasks*.

## Celebrating and promoting results
Although each member works in a team, we are all part of the same big family, and the accomplishment of one of us should make us all happy.

This involves disseminating and filling out surveys, supporting data collection, and promoting accomplishments on social media.

Finally, as people will leave the lab as they will graduate, find jobs, or move to their next chapter in life, we will celebrate their departures knowing that the lab will hopefully remain a wonderful memory.
