# Institutional Review Board
An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a committee that is responsible for reviewing, approving, and monitoring research involving human subjects to ensure that the rights, safety, and well-being of participants are protected. Research studies must undergo IRB approval if they involve direct data collection from human subjects and if they have to be published.

**See the chart below to understand whether your study requires IRB approval**

![To IRB or not to IRB?](https://github.com/NKU-HCI-lab/resources-hci-lab/blob/main/assets/irb-or-not-irb.gif?raw=true)

Secondary data (that is, data collected previously and already publicly available), does not involve direct data collection and therefore the study does not require IRB approval.


# Survey design
## Demographic questions
Demographic survey questions ask survey respondents for background information to help survey creators better understand their audience. Demographic questions often ask about respondentsâ€™ age, gender, race, ethnicity, income, employment status, level of education, marital status, and more.

## Likert scale questions
A Likert scale is a psychometric scale commonly used in questionnaires and surveys to measure attitudes, opinions, or perceptions. It typically consists of a series of statements or questions, and respondents are asked to indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with each statement on a symmetric scale.
