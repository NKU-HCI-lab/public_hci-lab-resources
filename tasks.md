## Create your profile on useful platforms
### LinkedIn (5-20 minutes)
LinkedIn is a professional networking platform that allows users to create a profile showcasing their work experience, education, skills, and accomplishments. It enables users to connect with colleagues, classmates, and other professionals in their field, as well as discover job opportunities, join industry-specific groups, and engage in discussions. LinkedIn serves as a powerful tool for building and maintaining professional relationships, enhancing career prospects, and staying informed about the latest developments in one's industry.

2. Connect with the other members of our lab (https://cprnhl.com/hcilab)

### GitHub (5 minutes)
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration features for software development projects. It allows users to create a profile, host and manage their coding projects, and collaborate with other developers worldwide. GitHub enables users to store and share their code repositories, track changes, and contribute to open-source projects. It also serves as a portfolio for developers, showcasing their skills and projects to potential employers or collaborators.

1. Visit https://github.com/join
2. Connect with the other members of our lab (https://cprnhl.com/hcilab)

### ResearchGate (5 minutes)
ResearchGate is a social networking site designed specifically for scientists and researchers to share their work, collaborate with others, and discover new research in their field. Users can create a profile highlighting their publications, research projects, and expertise, as well as connect with other researchers worldwide. ResearchGate allows users to upload and share research papers, ask and answer questions, and engage in discussions with the scientific community, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing across various disciplines.

To complete this task:

2. Connect with the other members of our lab (https://cprnhl.com/hcilab)

### Google Scholar (2 minutes - only work on this if you have a paper published)
Google Scholar is a web search engine that focuses on indexing scholarly literature, including articles, theses, books, preprints, and court opinions from various disciplines. It allows users to search for and access academic content, as well as create a public profile showcasing their publications and citations. Google Scholar helps researchers track their citation counts, find related articles, and stay up-to-date with the latest research in their field, making it an essential tool for academics and students alike.

To complete this task:
1. Visit https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html
2. Connect with the other members of our lab (https://cprnhl.com/hcilab)


#### ORCID (5 minutes)
ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a nonprofit organization that provides researchers with a unique, persistent digital identifier. This identifier helps disambiguate researchers with similar names and ensures proper attribution of their work across various platforms and databases. By creating an ORCID profile, researchers can connect their publications, grants, and other research activities to their identifier, making it easier for others to find and cite their work. ORCID integrates with many research workflows and systems, enhancing the discoverability and recognition of researchers' contributions.

To complete this task:
1. Visit https://orcid.org/register
2. Save your ORCID ID somewhere
