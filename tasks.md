### Google Scholar
Google Scholar is a web search engine that focuses on indexing scholarly literature, including articles, theses, books, preprints, and court opinions from various disciplines. It allows users to search for and access academic content, as well as create a public profile showcasing their publications and citations. Google Scholar helps researchers track their citation counts, find related articles, and stay up-to-date with the latest research in their field, making it an essential tool for academics and students alike.

To complete this task:
1. Visit https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/citations.html
2. Connect with the other members of our lab (https://cprnhl.com/hcilab)


#### ORCID (5 minutes)
ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) is a nonprofit organization that provides researchers with a unique, persistent digital identifier. This identifier helps disambiguate researchers with similar names and ensures proper attribution of their work across various platforms and databases. By creating an ORCID profile, researchers can connect their publications, grants, and other research activities to their identifier, making it easier for others to find and cite their work. ORCID integrates with many research workflows and systems, enhancing the discoverability and recognition of researchers' contributions.

To complete this task:
1. Visit https://orcid.org/register
2. Save your ORCID ID somewhere
